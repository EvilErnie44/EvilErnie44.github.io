          <h1>Melee</melee>
          <h3>Against All Odds</h3>
          <p>This model likes fighting against tough odds, the more foes the merrier. Enemies in base contact with this model do not receive melee bonuses when outnumbering this model in melee.Instead, this model receives a +1 to its Melee stat when outnumbered in close combat.</p>
          <h3>Careful Blow</h3>
          <p>This model can study an enemy and find a chink in any armor. All melee attacks made by this model have the Ignore Armor (1)* ability. </p>
          <h3>Defender</h3>
          <p>This model is a careful and slow opponent, the better to outlast its opponents. When attacked in melee this model receives a +1 to its Melee and Defense stats.</p>
          <h3>Flurry of Blows</h3>
          <p> This model prefers to make numerous attacks each round, hopefully catching its enemies off balance. On any turn this model makes a melee attack, it gains an additional free AP that may only be used to make another melee attack. This second attack suffers -1 Melee stat penalty.</p>
          <h3>Opportunist</h3>
          <p>This model can feel the flow of battle and knows the perfect time to counterattack, catching its foes off balance. When resolving the to-hit phase  of melee combat, this model treats all ties as a  win instead</p>
          <h3>Quick Charge</h3>
          <p>Even after suffering a misstep, this model can catch its quarry in melee. On any turn in which the model fails an Activation test, this model may take a second move action for free, but only if able to complete a charge move into contact with the enemy. </p>

      <div class="collapse" id="marksman">
        <div class="card card-body">
          <h1>Marksmanship</h1>
          <h3>Called Shot</h3>
          <p>This model has trained in picking out weak or exposed parts of its enemies. Prior to rolling to hit in ranged combat, this model may declare a called shot. The TN of the shot changes from 10 to 12; all other ranged combat rules apply. If the model successfully hits the target, that hit receives +1 Strength and has the Ignore Armor (1)* ability.</p>
          <h3>Fast-Tracker</h3>
          <p>This model can easily peg a fast moving target. It ignores the -1 penalty to shooting when firing at targets that have double-moved.</p>

                  <h3>Field-Strip</h3>
          <p>This model can take apart and rebuild its weapon blindfolded, so fixing a jam is a cakewalk. When using the unjam action, this model may remove two Jammed tokens instead of just one with a single AP.</p>
                        <h3>Marksman</h3>
          <p> This model knows how to compensate when firing at concealed targets. When shooting, this model ignores the -1 penalty when shooting at a model in soft cover and only suffers a -1 penalty when shooting at a model in hard cover.</p>
                          <h3>Range Finder</h3>
          <p>This model has an eye for distances and can shoot accurately at long range. When shooting a weapon the model adds 6" to the weapon’s maximum range. This extra range does not affect or apply to any range-dependent abilities the weapon may have and may not be used with relic or support weapons or any weapon that uses the flame template.</p>
                          <h3>Steady Hands</h3>
          <p>Gunfights are won by nerve and a steady aim, all else is luck. This model receives a +1 bonus when shooting if it does not move during its activation, either before or after shooting.</p>
              </div>
          </div>

              <div class="collapse" id="survival">
                <div class="card card-body">
                  <h1>Survival</h1>
                  <h3>Brace</h3>
                  <p>This model has stayed alive by knowing how to roll with blows or how to best take advantage of cover. This model may spend 1 AP on its turn to “Brace”. If it does so, the model receives a +1 to its Defense stat until the start of its next activation</p>
                  <h3>Hard as Nails</h3>
                  <p>This model knows how to take a hit, either a stoic refusal to show weakness or a fervent belief in its own skills. After being hit by any attack, but before the roll to wound, this model may roll a D10. Reduce the Strength of the attack by the result of the die roll. If this would make the attack’s Strength 0 or lower, the attack is negated entirely. This special ability may only be used once per game.</p>
                  <h3>Ranger</h3>
                  <p>This model is a master of shadowing their opponent’s movements and setting up skilled ambushes. Regardless of any scenario conditions, this model may be deployed anywhere on the board that is at least 12” away from any enemy model and is behind a terrain feature large enough to conceal them. If this model’s warband deploys before the enemy, this model may be put on the table after the enemy has been deployed. A model with this rule cannot use the Reconnoiter skill in the same game it uses this skill. A warband may never have more than three models with the Ranger skill. If multiple warbands have Rangers, roll off to determine who will use this ability first.</p>
                  <h3>Reactive</h3>
                  <p> This model has an affinity for the ebb and flow of battle and can often exploit an enemy’s missteps. This model receives a +1 bonus when making Activation tests. A model cannot have this skill and the Nimble Skill. </p>
                  <h3>Survivalist </h3>
                  <p>This model has learned the way of the wastes. The model receives a +2 bonus when taking any Survival test.</p>
                  <h3>Trekker </h3>
                  <p>This model is an expert in moving through the brush. When moving through difficult terrain the model may attempt an Agility test (MET/TN 10) for free. On a success, the model moves through the terrain without penalty to its Move stat. On a failure, the model moves through the terrain with normal movement penalties. </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="collapse" id="smarts">
              <div class="card card-body">
                <h1>Smarts</h1>
                <h3>Clever</h3>
                <p>This model is naturally intelligent. The model receives a +2 bonus when taking any Intelligence test.</p>
                <h3>Gunsmith</h3>
                <p>The model is a talented gunsmith, which makes weapon malfunctions less common. The entire warband ignores the first Jam result of the game, regardless of the number of Jammed tokens generated. This ability may not be saved up and occurs during the first Fumble when shooting.</p>
                <h3>Haggler</h3>
                <p>This model is silver-tongued and is a masterful barterer. After each game, when buying new items, the model may roll a D10 and reduce the cost of a single piece of equipment’s cost by the die result, to a minimum of 1. This may only be done once per game and the item must be declared before the roll is made. Note that the player is not required to purchase the reduced-price item and the item counts its full cost when determining the model’s total cost.</p>
                <h3>Maintainer</h3>
                <p> This model takes pride in keeping its weapons in top working order. This skill reduces the Reliability rating of any weapon carried by the model by 1, to a minimum of 1.</p>
                <h3>Resourceful</h3>
                <p>Either due to a regular income or simply a knack for finding treasure among trash, this model brings home the irradiated bacon. This model adds an additional D10 BS to the warband’s total when determining income after each game during a campaign. Only two models may have this ability per warband at any one time.</p>
                <h3>Scavenger</h3>
                <p>This model is a master scrounger and always comes with extra supplies and rations. When taking any weapon with the Limited Ammo special rule, this model may roll 2D3 when determining ammo quantity and take the highest result of the two; adding an additional 2 afterwards. Additionally, after a campaign game, upkeep costs do not need to be paid for  this model during the End of Game  sequence. Freelancers cannot  take this skill; they only  play for pay.</p>

                <h3>Leap</h3>
                <p>This model is a supreme hurdler. During a move action the model may cross any linear terrain obstacle that is 1" or less high without any reduction  in movement.</p>
                <h3>Nimble</h3>
                <p> This model has prodigious speed and is  faster than most. This model receives a +1 bonus to Activation tests. A model cannot have this skill and the Reactive skill.</p>
                <h3>Quick</h3>
                <p> This model is naturally dexterous. It receives a +2 bonus when taking any Agility test. </p>
                <h3>Reconnoiter</h3>
                <p>When in the field, this model prefers to be at the forefront looking for ambushes and other dangers. At the start of the game, after all models have deployed, but before Initiative is determined, this model may make a free move action. </p>
                <h3>Spring-Heeled</h3>
                <p>This model is quick to its feet and hard to keep pinned down. When prone this model may stand without paying any AP; this ability may only be used during the model’s activation</p>

                <h3>Brute</h3>
                <p> This model is a bruiser with arms like tree trunks. The model receives a +1 to its Strength stat when making melee attacks. It also ignores the Heavy weapon rule for any weapon it uses</p>
                <h3>Blitzer</h3>
                <p>This model likes to trample its opponent into the dust. When charging, this model may choose to receive +2 to Strength for its melee attack, but if they do they suffer a -1 penalty to hit. </p>
                <h3>Bully</h3>
                <p> This model likes to make its enemies eat dirt. All enemies defeated by this model in close combat are knocked prone in addition to any other combat resul</p>
                <h3>Muscular</h3>
                <p> This model is naturally brawny. The model receives a +2 bonus when taking any Strength test. </p>
                <h3>Pushoff</h3>

                <h3>Strong Point</h3>
                <p>This model is accustomed to the rigors of wearing heavy armor and suffers no penalties to its Move stat or Agility tests when wearing any type  of armor. </p>
                  <h3>Tosser</h3>
                <p>Instead of attempting to wound after hitting an enemy model in melee, this model may force the enemy model to make an opposed Strength test against it. If the model with this ability wins, the enemy is picked up and thrown 3" in a direction of the thrower’s choice. The thrown model, and any intervening model hit by the thrown model, takes a Strength 5 hit after landing, and the thrown model becomes prone. If the enemy model wins the opposed Strength roll, nothing further happens and combat continues as normal, counting that round as a tie. </p>

                <h3>Brave</h3>
                <p> This model is naturally courageous. This model receives a +2 bonus when taking any Will tests.</p>
                <h3>Confident</h3>
                <p>This model has faith in a higher power, supreme confidence in itself, or just believes it is extreme lucky. It may reroll all failed Morale and  Grazed tests</p>
                <h3>Fearful Reputation</h3>
                <p> This model has a reputation throughout the wasteland, either as a cold-hearted killer, a maniac, or just someone not to be trifled with. All enemy models that attempt to charge this model or move within base contact must pass a Will test (MET/TN 10). If the attacker fails this test they may perform any alternative action instead, but cannot get closer to the model this turn.</p>
                <h3>Frother</h3>
                <p> This model chooses to lose control of itself when entering combat. This model receives the Frenzied rule if it does not have it already. While frenzied – which takes place after the model has failed its Intelligence test (MET/TN 10) to resist Frenzy– the model receives a +1 to its Melee and Strength stats until end of the game. Also, this model may voluntarily choose to fail any Intelligence test for going frenzied. Frenzied is discussed under the General Abilities section.</p>
                <h3>Gung Ho </h3>
                <p>This model takes the “do or die” ethos a little too literally. When this model is taken out-of-action, do not remove them from the table or place them prone. Instead, the model remains on the table for one more turn until the end of its next Activation, after which it succumbs to its wounds and is taken out-of-action as normal. During this final round of activation, the Gung Ho model is immune to all Will tests and adds +2 to its Defense stat. If this model suffers any further wounds prior to its next activation, then remove the model  as normal.</p>
                <h3>Unfazed</h3>
                <p>This model cares little for the buzzing of bullets, considering them less than flies. This model automatically passes all Grazed tests, but may choose to fail as normal.</p>

                <h1>Leadership</h1>
                <h3>All Together</h3>
                <p> By focusing their attention the leader encourages its fellows to better coordinate their movements. To use this ability the model must spend an AP on their activation. Immediately afterwards, any number of friendly models within 3" may activate, this counts as their activation for their turn and no Activation test is required. The models all activate simultaneously and may only make a single move action, which may be a charge. If necessary resolve any charge attacks for one model before moving onto  the next.</p>
                <h3>Assertive </h3>
                <p>Naturally persistent, this model presses any advantage given to them. If this model rolls a Critical result on an Activation test, they receive 3 AP instead of the normal 2.</p>
                <h3>Bold</h3>
                <p>  This model is a natural leader and inspires courage in all those around it. Any friendly models within 12" of this model and in line of sight gain +1 to all Will tests. This ability is not cumulative with other models that have the same skill.</p>
                <h3>Motivator</h3>
                <p> Through inspiring speeches, bullying or threats, this model can get others to give their all. All friendly models within 6" of this model receive a +1 bonus when making Activation tests. A model may only benefit from the Motivator skill once per Activation test, regardless if multiple sources are within range.</p>
                <h3>Tactician</h3>
                <p>This model is a student of warfare and can adjust its plans to react to enemy movements. At the start of the game, after all models are placed, but before initiative is determined, the owning player may roll a D6 and redeploy that many members of their warband. The models must be redeployed using the same scenario restrictions. This ability may only be used by each player once and if two opposing warbands have this ability, both roll a die and the highest scorer may choose to redeploy first or second.</p>

                <h1>Hidden Mutations</h1>
                <h3>Acid Spit</h3>
                <p> This model can spit the acidic components of its stomach at its enemies. Treat this ability as a ranged attack with a range of 16”, a Strength of 7, and with the Ignore Armor (1)* ability.</p>
                <h3>Caustic Blood</h3>
                <p>This model seems normal, buts its blood is dangerously acidic when exposed to air. Whenever this model is wounded or taken out-of-action, all models within 2" suffer an immediate Strength 7 hit.</p>
                <h3>Chameleon</h3>
                <p>This model can change its appearance to naturally blend into the background while hiding. Any model that is 12" or farther away from this model must pass an Intelligence test (MET/TN 10) if it wishes to attack the model with ranged attacks. Failure means it cannot make the attack, but may target another model that it can see. </p>
                <h3>Electric Shock</h3>
                <p> This model can generate electrostatic bursts. Any enemy model that comes in base contact with this model, or starts their activation in base contact with them, must pass an Agility test (MET/TN 10) or suffer an automatic Strength 6 hit. Determine the result of this hit before any actions are performed by either enemy or the mutant. Regardless of the result of any hits, only one enemy may be affected by this ability per game turn as the mutant needs time to recharge.</p>
                <h3>Energy Absorbtion</h3>
                <p>This mutant is capable of withstanding substantial levels of heat to no ill-effect. This model receives a +2 bonus to its Defense from hits from weapons with the Flammable*, Laser*, and Plasma* weapon abilities and cannot be set on fire by any means.</p>
                <h3>Flame Breath</h3>
                <p>The model can store volatile components in its body and spew them as an attack. The mutation is a Strength 4 ranged attack that uses the flame template and has the Flammable rule*. This ability cannot be reused until the model passes a Strength test (STR/TN 10) at the beginning of its activation. This test does not count as an action and can be repeated each activation at no AP cost.</p>
                <h3>Poisonous Belch</h3>
                <p>This model can release the noxious gases contained within its digestive system in a particularly violent and disgusting fashion. Treat this mutation as a ranged attack with a range of 12”, a Strength of 6, and has the Gas*, Poison*, and Small Blast* rules.</p>
                <h3>Psychic</h3>
                <p>This mutant possesses psychic ability, whether it wants it or not. This model gains a randomly determined psychic mutation at no cost and can gain additional psychic mutations instead of Hidden or Physical Mutations, if the player so chooses. This ability may be duplicated; each level generates one additional psychic power. See the Psychic section for options.</p>
                  <h3>Radioactive</h3>
                <p>This model is capable of leaking radiation from its body. During its activation the model can spend 1 AP to irradiate all models, friendly and foe, within range. Place the Large Blast Template over the irradiating model, all models underneath are affected. All affected models must pass two Survival tests (MET/TN 10) as if they were in an irradiated area with an Intensity of 2; each failure results in a -1 to victim’s Defense stat for the rest of the game. This ability cannot be reused until the model passes a Strength test (STR/TN 10) at the beginning of its activation. This test does not count as an action and can be repeated during activation at  no AP cost. This model is also immune to the effects  of radiation. The full rules for radiation are listed  under the Radiation Zone under the Wasteland Encounters section.</p>
                  <h3>Vampiric Drain </h3>
                <p>This mutant exudes a life-draining aura, weakening those around them. All models within 4" of this model suffer a -1 penalty to their Defense stat. This ability does not affect robots. </p>
                  <h3>Webs</h3>
                <p>This model can shoot webbing out of concealed pouches on its hands or other parts of its body. Treat this as a 12" ranged attack with the Burst* weapon rule. Instead of rolling to wound, the target if hit counts as webbed. A webbed model cannot take any actions that require movement (shooting, melee, most non-passive special abilities) until it breaks free by passing a Strength test (STR/TN 10) at the beginning of its next turn. This Strength test (STR/TN 10) costs 1 AP. Psychic powers may be used while immobile.</p>

                <p>(Cost Free) – This mutant has large spikes that jut out from various parts of its body. Any model that makes a melee attack against this model must pass Agility test (MET/TN10) or suffer a Strength 6 hit. Models armed with a weapon with a Melee Range of 1" or greater may ignore this ability</p>
                <h3>Big</h3>
                <p>(Cost 15 BS) – This mutant is larger than the majority of its kin. This model receives a +1 to its Strength and counts as having the Large general ability; which is listed under General Abilities.</p>
                <h3>Blob Form</h3>
                <p>(Cost 5 BS) – This model has an amorphous mass for a body and has no discernible interior anatomy. This model receives a +2 to its Defense stat against all ranged attacks from firearms, and all of its close combat attacks have a Melee Range of 1”, regardless of the actual weapon used. However, the model cannot apply its Defense bonus against any weapon with the Flammable*, Laser*, or Plasma* special ability. Further, when affected by a weapon with the Flammable* ability it must roll two dice for the Agility test (MET/TN 10) and choose the lowest result.</p>
                <h3>Burrow</h3>
                <p>(Cost 10 BS) – This model has the ability to burrow through dirt and rock, either because of large mole-like claws or the ability to secrete acidic saliva. This model may spend 1 AP to go underground. While underground, it moves normally, ignores terrain while doing so, and cannot be targeted by ranged weapons, special abilities, or melee attacks. This model must spend 1 AP to reemerge, and if enough AP is available the model may burrow, move underground, and reemerge in the same activation. This model cannot begin to burrow or reemerge in solid rock, asphalt, concrete, water, or other similar circumstances (apply common sense). However, while moving underground the model may bypass these obstructions, though it cannot enter enclosed spaces such as underground vaults or bunkers. 
                There is no limit to the number of turns a model may stay underground. However, a burrowing model may not claim, or carry scenario objectives with them while underground; dropping them if they do. Furthermore, should any scenario conditions require a warband to specifically attack or engage that model and the game ends while the model is underground, the enemy warband gains full Victory Points (or other positive conditions), as if the model burrowing model was taken out of action. The burrower need not roll on the Survival Table if this occurs.   
                </p>
                <h3>Carapace</h3>
                <p>(Cost 10 BS) – This mutant possesses a hardened outer shell that gives it significant natural protection. This model receives an Armor Bonus (+2).</p>
                <h3>Crushing Claws</h3>
                <p>(Cost 15 BS) – This mutant has large claws instead of hands, like a crab or lobster. This model cannot use any weapons and equipment and must pass an Agility test (MET/TN 10) to open doors or any other task that requires the use of their hands. However, the model counts as being equipped with natural weapons and gains a total of +3 to Strength when attack with them, instead of just +1</p>
                <h3>Fearful Reputation</h3>
                <p>(Cost Free) – This mutant has a grotesque appearance or a bewildering accumulation of deformities. This mutation is identical to the Fearful Reputation skill.</p>
                <h3>Grasping Tentacles</h3>
                <p>(Cost Free) – This model has tentacles that snake about and grasp opponents. Any model in base contact with this model must pass a Strength test (STR/TN 10) when making a melee attack against this model or suffer a -2 to its Melee stat and a -1 to its Strength stat. The penalty goes away at the end of the attack</p>
                <h3>Long Arms </h3>
                <p>(Cost 3 BS) – This model has arms that are proportionally longer that its body size would indicate. This model gains a +1 to its Melee stat and all close combat attacks this model have a Melee Range of 1".</p>
                <h3>Long Legs/Multiple Legs</h3>
                <p>(Cost Free) – This mutant has legs that are abnormally long or more than two, giving it a faster gait. This model receives a +1 bonus to its Move stat</p>
                <h3>Multi-Limbed/Prehensile Tail</h3>
                <p>(Cost Free) – This model has a grasping appendage which allows it to wield an additional melee weapon or to better brace a firearm. This model may choose either the Flurry of Blows skill or Steady Hands skill for free when first recruited </p>
                <h3>Scorpion Tail</h3>
                <p>(Cost 5 BS) – This model has a tail with a stinger or other form of natural weapon. On any turn this model makes a melee attack, it gains 1 free AP that may only be used to make another melee attack at the model’s normal Strength. This extra attack also has the Poison* ability.</p> 
                <h3>Suction</h3>
                <p>(Cost 10 BS) – This model has large sucker-like feelers on its feet and legs and can stick to vertical surfaces. This model may traverse walls and other vertical areas as if it was in open terrain. Should this model ever be hit by an attack while on a vertical service, it must pass an Agility test (MET/TN 10) or fall down, following the normal rules for falling.</p>    
                <h3>Two-Headed </h3>
                <p>(Cost 10 BS) – This mutant has two heads and two different personalities that may sometimes be in conflict, but is quick to react when in agreement. When taking an Activation test (MET/TN 10), the model may reroll a failed result. A second failure means the heads have had a falling out and the model may gains no AP that turn at all. Note that all rules of the normal Activation test, such as turnovers, still apply.</p>  
                <h3>Weapon Growths</h3>
                <p>(Cost Free) – This mutant has a natural weapon in place of one of their normal hands, this can include a large claw, club fist, or sword-like bone protrusion. This model counts as being equipped with natural weapons and gains a +1 to their Melee stat. However, since the model cannot use their secondary hand to hold things, they may only ever use one-handed weapons and equipment. The model may further be equipped with a secondary natural weapon, which gives them a further +1 to their melee stat. However, if they do so they lose the ability to use any other weapons and equipment altogether and must pass an Agility test (MET/TN 10) to open doors or any other task that requires the use of their hands.</p>  
                <h3>Wings</h3>
                <p>(Cost 10 BS) – This model possesses large wings or has an ability that allows short bursts of flight or gliding. When moving, this model may ignore terrain. However, since it is not actually capable of sustained flight, the flying model must land at the end of its turn. If it lands in difficult terrain for any reason, it must pass an Agility test (MET/TN 10) or suffer a D6 Strength hit. Finally, should the model fall for any reason, they may take Agility test (MET/TN 10) to deploy their wings and avoid taking damage by landing softly. </p>

          <div class="collapse" id="psychic">
              <div class="card card-body">
                <h1>Psychic</h1>
                <h3>Cloud Mind</h3>
                <p>The psychic can cloud the minds of its enemies, hiding itself and his allies from their gaze. If successful, the psychic and all friendly models within 3” count as being in heavy cover until the beginning of the psychic’s next activation. Models already in heavy cover receive no additional benefit.</p>
                <h3>Demoralize</h3>
                <p>The psychic can implant thoughts of failure into its victim’s minds, weakening their resolve. Treat this as a 24" ranged attack. If successful, the target model and all enemy models within 3” of it must immediately pass a Morale test (MET/TN10).</p>
                <h3>Healing Touch</h3>
                <p>The mutant can use its mental energy to stimulate the healing abilities of allies. The TN for the Will test to use this ability is 11 instead of the normal 10. If successful, one model in base contact that has gone out of action may be brought back into play. The model comes back into play with one wound and is prone. The psychic may also use this ability to return one wound to any multi-wound model currently in play, though this can never take that model above its starting wound total. This ability does  not work on models with the robot type.</p>
                <h3>Levitation</h3>
                <p>The mutant can resist the pull of gravity and float about for a short time. If successful, the model may make an immediate, free Move action that ignores terrain. However, since it is not actually capable of sustained flight, the levitating model must land at the end of its turn. If it lands in difficult terrain for any reason, it must pass an Agility test (MET/TN 10) or suffer a D6 Strength hit.</p>
                <h3>Mind Shield</h3>
                <p>This ability allows the psychic to create a psychic shield to protect itself. If successful, the psychic receives an Armor Bonus (+2) that lasts as long as the mutant can maintain concentration. To do so, the mutant must a pass a Will test at the start of its activation. This does not cost AP and does not count as using a psychic power for the turn. If they fail this test, the Armor Bonus is lost. This ability is also automatically lost if the psychic fails any type of Will test.  </p>
                <h3>Pyschic Battery</h3>
                <p>This model possesses an enhanced cerebral cortex, which acts as an amplifier for psychic abilities. This model may use two psychic powers, which may be the same power twice, except for Mind Shield, during their activation for 1 AP each. However, any time the model uses a second psychic power during the same activation, the second Will test (MET/TN 10) suffers a -1 penalty and any Fumbles will result in a Strength 6 hit instead of Strength D6. Finally, models with psychic battery gain an additional randomly determined psychic mutation at no cost</p>
                <h3>Pyschic Bolt</h3>
                <p>The psychic can  throw a bolt of pure energy  towards its enemy. If successful,  treat this as ranged attack with  a range of 24”, a Strength of 7,  and with the Small Blast*  weapon ability.</p>

              <div class="card card-body">
                <h1>Detriments</h1>
                <h3>Attrophied Muscles</h3>
                <p>This mutant’s musculature is flawed and is slow to repair itself from daily use. The model suffers a -1 to its Strength stat.</p>
                <h3>Daylight Sensitivity</h3>
                <p> This mutant functions poorly when exposed to the sun’s harsh rays. While in daylight this model suffers a -1 penalty to its Mettle stat. Unless otherwise noted in scenario rules, all battles are assumed to happen during daylight hours. During the night time or when a fully enclosed space (indoors, for example) the model receives a +1 bonus to Mettle instead of the penalty</p>
                <h3>Frailty</h3>
                <p>The mutant suffers is extremely sensitive to pain or has a weak bone structure. It suffers a -1 to its Defense stat.</p>
                <h3>Rotted Mind</h3>
                <p>This mutant is preoccupied with its own thoughts and can barely swing a club without being told to do so. This model receives a -1 penalty to Activation tests (MET/TN 10) if not within 3” of a friendly model</p>
                <h3>Unending Pain</h3>
                <p> The culmination of this model’s mutations causes it constant agony and drives it into a near rage at the slightest provocations. This model gains the Frenzied special rule, which is described in the General Abilities section. If it possesses this special rule, the mutant receives a -2 penalty to the Intelligence test (MET/TN 10) to restrain itself. </p>
                <h3>Weakening Sight</h3>
                <p>The model’s eyesight has started to fade or a facial mutation partially blocks its vision. This model receives a -1 penalty to its Ranged stat.</p>
                <h3>Atrophied Arm</h3>
                <p>One of this mutant’s arms has atrophied leading to the point of uselessness. This model may use one-handed weapons normally, though they may not use two at the same time. Additionally, they may use a two-handed weapon, but suffer a -2 penalty to any roll using it as they must grip it awkwardly</p>
                <h3>Inert Twin</h3>
                <p>This model has a deceased conjoined sibling attached to the outside of its body, which severely affects its balance. This model receives a -1 penalty to its Move stat and a -1 penalty to all Agility tests (MET/TN 10).</p>
                <h3>No Arms</h3>
                <p>This model has simple nubs where its arms should be, forcing it to rely on its feet for feats of dexterity. This model may only wield a single one-handed weapon, which takes some finesse, and must pass an Agility test (MET/TN 10) to use any actions normally completed with hands (opening doors, for example). Due to compensating with its feet, this model gains a +1 to its Move stat. This model loses this detriment if it ever gains any type of appendage. If this model ever gains the Prehensile Tail mutation, reroll the result.</p>
                <h3>No Legs</h3>
                <p>This model is just a head, arms, and a torso, forcing it to move about using its hands or some other method. Since the mutant cannot brace a firearm properly while moving, all ranged weapons they carry count as having the Move or Fire ability* and they suffer a -1 penalty to their Move stat.</p>
                <h3>Obese</h3>
                <p>This model is extremely fat and slow to act and is easily winded. The model gains +1 to its Defense stat, but also receives a -1 penalty to its Move stat and to all Agility tests and may never take more than one Move action per activation. </p>
                <h3>Stumpy Leg</h3>
                <p>This mutant has only one good leg; the other is a twisted stump that can barely hold up the mutant’s weight. The model receives a -2 to its  Move stat.</p>

                <h1>General Abilities</h1>
                <h3>Soft-bellied </h3>
                <p>This model has lived its entire life under the protection of the settlements or has poor survival skills. The model receives a -2 to all Survival tests.</p>
                <h3>Coward</h3>
                <p>This model is craven and will forsake friends and allies if ever put into real danger. When making any Morale or Grazed test, this model receives a -2 penalty.</p>
                <h3>Dumb</h3>
                <p>This model is not particularly bright. This model receives a -2 penalty when taking any Intelligence test.</p>
                <h3>Frenzied</h3>
                <p> This model is deranged and is not really capable of controlling its bloodlust. At the beginning of its activation, this model must take an Intelligence test (MET/TN10). This test does not cost AP and success means it may activate as normal; failure indicates the model has lost control. When this occurs, the model may not take any other actions other than to charge or move towards the closest enemy model, or make a melee attack if in base contact with an enemy. Additionally, while frenzied the model gains the Brave skill. On subsequent activations, the model may test to restrain its anger by taking another Intelligence test (MET/TN 10) to return to normal. This test does not require AP.</p>
                <h3>Hatred</h3>
                <p>The model has a burning anger towards a particular person or group. When this model fight against an opposing warband containing models the model “hates” he gains the Frenzied general ability for the duration of game</p>
                <h3>Huge</h3>
                <p>This model is extremely large, standing at least 12' tall. The model gains an additional wound and receives the combat bonus for being Large even against other Large opponents. Otherwise this model follows  all other rules associated with Large models. Huge models should be placed on a larger sized base than Large models. </p>
                <h3>Integral</h3>
                <p>This robot has a melee or ranged weapon permanently attached to one of its arms. The weapon may not be disarmed or lost by the model unless they are killed. Further, the model is allowed to have the integral weapon be a two-handed weapon, which allows them to use both the two-handed weapon and a single-handed weapon at the same time; they may not be armed with two two-handed weapons simultaneously. In between games the model is free to change or remove the integral weapon. A robot may only have two integral weapons. Note that having an integral weapon inhibits the robots ability to function in its environment, so players should agree that if the robot attempts such an action, such as climbing, they should receive a penalty of some type. This is not delineated here due to the possible number of exceptions, just be gentlemanly or lady-like about it. </p>
                <h3>Large</h3>
                <p>This model is bigger than the average-sized human, standing 8 feet tall. This model receives a +1 bonus to Melee when in combat with models without the Large special rule, an additional wound, and may take a Strength test (STR/TN 10) to resist any ability that will involuntarily move or knock the model prone. Also, smaller models do not block line of sight to this model. Note: to differentiate its special status, this model should be placed on a larger than normal base.</p>
                <h3>Medic</h3>
                <p>This model is medically trained or is a natural healer. When in base contact, the model may try to heal any model of its warband that has been taken out-of-action. By spending 1 AP the Medic may attempt an Intelligence test (MET/TN 12). Success means the model is brought back into play with one wound. Additionally, after the battle, assuming this model does not go out-of-action, one model in the warband may be nominated to receive a +1 bonus when rolling on the Survival Table. Does not work on models with the  Robot type.</p>
                <h3>Ragtag</h3>
                <p>The model is poorly armed and equipped. It may never have more than 15 Barter Scrip worth of equipment, including weaponry and armor</p>
                <h3>Up-Armed</h3>
                <p>Within their warband this model is assigned to use and maintain any heavy weapons. This model may purchase any support weapon. </p>
                <h3>Ungainly</h3>
                <p>This model is not so quick on its feet. It receives a -2 to all Agility tests.</p>
